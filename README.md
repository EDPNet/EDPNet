# EDPNet
#you need to download xception_pytorch_imagenet.pth and put it into the folder,imitmodel

### Usage
1. Requirement:
The proposed EDPNet was trained and predicted based on deep learning server using an NVIDIA GTX 3090 24 GB GPU and a 3.00 GHz Intel Core i9-10980 XE CPU64GB main memory. We implement the programming based on Pytorch-gpu 1.7.1 deep learning framework in Python 3.6 language. The NVIDIA GTX 3090 GPU is powered by CUDA 11.1.
